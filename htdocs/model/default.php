/**
 * Model
 *
 * Your logic can go here. Models
 * are loaded using the same pattern
 * as theme files and so will match
 * your theme.
 *
 * Example:
 * User opens yoursite.com/one/page/url
 * The model will search as follows:
 *
 * one/page/url.php
 * one-page-url.php
 * one/page.php
 * one-page.php
 * one.php
 * default.php
 *
 * NOTE: Avoid the overriding following
 * variable keys with new arrays as they're
 * used by the theme.
 *
 * @var site
 * @var page
 * @var dev
 * @var user
 *
 * Set theme variables using the $_ array.
